#Literally HTML
A minimal framework to harness the power of simplicity found in DOM Parsing and string literals.

src/components | Example code to demonstrate a two component hierarchy and simple pub/sub behavior.
There also exists some experimentation with the next feature I want to add - state management utilities.

src/LiterallyHtml.ts | The file containing the framework. Seriously, it's that small.

#Explanation
You may 'react' at first by questioning why I wouldn't just use one of the more popular and powerful frameworks.
I would answer this question through analogy of transportation: If you are merely running to the grocery store,
you not need the speed of a formula one racecar. Additionally, if the racecar is to break down or otherwise become
faulty, you will run into great trouble attempting to fix it in comparison to the complexity of fixing a bicycle.
A bicycle is also much more intuitive to operate, whereas a car takes some training to operate.

So if you're just running to the grocery store, you might consider just using Literally HTML over React.
